# sound-collage
An interactive music application allowing users to create sample banks from sounds captured in the microphone.
Create sound collages from found sounds and play the captured sounds on a classic 16-pad sampler to make surprising layers and beats. Can also be used as a tool for arranging compositions by recording sections to sampler pads.
