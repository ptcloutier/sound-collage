# sound-collage
An interactive music application for playing with sounds captured in the microphone.
Create sound collages from found sounds and play the captured audio on a classic 16-pad sampler. Makes surprising layers and beats, great for reamping recordings and experimenting with new sounds. Can also be used as a tool for arranging compositions by recording sections to sampler pads.

Each sampler pad has a chain of audio players allowing for complex layering of sounds. Easy selection of audio effects whose parameters can be adjusted by touch points in the parameter view.
